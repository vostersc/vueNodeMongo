/*
Create below an express.js route that queries a Mongo database to get all the customer logs
for a given locationId and date range and returns them grouped by customer.
The relevant database tables have the following structures:
locations {
  locationId,
  name,
  createdDate
}

customers {
  customerId,
  locationId,
  firstName,
  lastName,
  email,
  phone,
  createdDate
}

customerLogs {
  customerId,
  type,
  text,
  date
}
*/

// Use db as the mongo connection object
// Assume req.body contains a locationId, startDate and endDate.
router.post('/opiniionTest', function(res, req) {
  res.send('Finished!');
});
